;;; Commentary:

;; The point of this package is to allow fetching web pages in
;; parallel -- but control the level of parallelism to avoid DoS-ing
;; web servers and Emacs.

;;; Code:

(require 'url-parse)
(require 'with-url)

The variable `url-queue-timeout' sets a timeout."

;; number of queue runners), and 2) at the exit of each job, which
;; will then not start any further threads, but just reuse the

  "Retrieve URL and execute BODY with point in a buffer with the response.

Example:

  (with-url (headers \"http://fsf.org/\")
    (message \"The size of the FSF front page is %s\" (buffer-size)))

The buffer is killed after BODY has exited.

Additional keywords can be given to `with-url' to alter its operation.

The returned headers can be examined with the `url-header'
function; the full status with the `url-status' function, and
whether the request returned as expected with the `url-okp' or
`url-errorp' functions.

:wait t
Normal `with-url' operation is asynchronous.  If this parameter
is given, the retrieval will be synchronous instead.  Not all
URLs support asynchronous operation.  In particular, file: and
ftp: documents will always be fetchedh synchronously.

:timeout SECONDS
Give up after approximately SECONDS seconds and execute BODY.

:read-timeout SECONDS
If no data has been received for the last SECONDS seconds, give
up and execute BODY.

:verbose NUMBER
The level of verbosity during operations.  0 will men no messages
are issued.

:debug BOOL
If non-nil, a buffer called \"*url-debug*\" will be created, and
all network traffic, both request and response, is copied to that
buffer.  This buffer may grow very large.

:ignore-errors BOOL
If non-nil, the body will not be executed if the contents
specified by the URL could not be fetched.

:follow-redirects BOOL
If non-nil (which is the default), follow HTTP redirects until
the final document is reached.

:cookies t/read/write/nil
If nil, cookies will neither be sent nor stored.  If `read',
cookies will be recorded, but not sent.  If `write', cookies will
be sent, but not stored.  If nil, no cookie handling will occur.

:headers ALIST
Add ALIST to the headers sent over to the server.  This should typically
look like

  ((\"User-Agent\" \"Emacs\"))

If the header name is the same as one of the automatically
generated headers, the value from this list will override the
automatically generated header.  To disable the header
completely, use nil as the value.

Additional elements in this alist are interpreted as the coding
system (defaulting to `utf-8') and the encoding
method (defaulting to `url-encode').

:method GET/POST/etc
The method to use for retrieving an HTTP(S) resource.  This defaults
to GET, and other popular values are POST, UPDATE and PUT.

:data STRING/ALIST
Data to include in the body of the HTTP(S) request when using
POST, UPDATE or PUT.  This can either be a string or an alist of POST values
on this form:

  '((\"NAME\" \"VALUE\")
    (\"submit\")
    ((\"NAME1\" \"VALUE1\")
     (\"NAME2\" \"VALUE2\")))

Elements with several values only make sense with the `multipart'
encoding (see below).

:data-charset CHARSET
What charset (i.e., encoded character set) this data should be
encoded as.  This defaults to `utf-8'.

:data-encoding ENCODING
When using the posting methods, the data is usually encoded in
some fashion.  Supported encodings are `url-form', `multipart'
and `base64'."
